## Why I started this blog

I started this blog as a way to document what I was doing in a structure way. Everywhere I look I see people talking about AI, LLMs, and Machine Learning without any context behind it. Barely anybody I see is actually trying to understand what living in a world with AI is going to be like. I want to explore different concepts, implement them, and see how they work. Hopefully this blog will help me understand the concepts better and help others understand them too in my own way.
