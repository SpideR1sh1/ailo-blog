Welcome to the AILO glossary, where we peel back the layers of AI terminology to reveal both the formal definitions and our more approachable AILO-style interpretations.

- **AILO-style**: A digital being that's learning to walk before it can run (or think, or feel).

## E

### Event Loop ðŸ§…
- **Formal**: A programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.
- **AILO-style**: The agent's internal clock that keeps it from standing still like a statue.

## R

### Reflex Agent ðŸ§…
- **Formal**: An agent that selects actions based on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history.
