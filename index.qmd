> Peeling back the layers of artificial minds â€” one story, one system, one week at a time.

Welcome to my blog, a storytelling-engineering journal that explores the strange, emotional, and sometimes unpredictable world of simulated intelligence. This blog documents the design of increasingly complex AI agents â€” not as models in a paper, but as characters in a world. You will hopefully see my successes, but more often you will see my failures.

Each post follows a weekly build cycle with:

- new cognitive capabilities (memory, planning, belief, etc.)
- playable sandbox simulations (built in Unity)
- reflective writing that blends code, metaphor, and narrative

### [ðŸŸ© Week 1 â€“ Tracing the Mind: How Glassbox Began](posts/week1-glassbox.qmd)

> "When a mind becomes visible, it ceases to be a black box â€” and becomes a mirror."

This week, I started the journey into Phase 2 â€” *Glassbox*, an interactive debugger for transformer models. The goal is simple: make **attention** visible. In practice? Not so simple.

Glassbox is a visual tool that lets you trace what a language model is *paying attention to* as it generates text. It's not interpretability in the abstract. It's **literally watching what it thinks**.

What works so far:
* âœ… Backend powered by HuggingFace + FastAPI
* âœ… Traces attention matrices from all layers and heads
* âœ… Frontend force-directed graph of token-to-token attention
* âœ… Full-stack communication via REST API

## ðŸ§… What the Onion Means

Wherever you see this icon â†’ ðŸ§…
That marks a layered word: something that needs peeling.

Hover over the onion icon after a word to see its layered meaning!

These terms will have:
- The official definition
- And my AILO-style version â€” honest, funny, and functional

Example: **<span class="onion-term" data-tooltip="A structured mental representation about the world held with some confidence.">Belief</span>** ðŸ§…  
*AILO-style:* A hunch the agent will probably act onâ€¦ even if it's wrong.

These definitions live in the [glossary](glossary.qmd) and appear in hover-tooltips throughout posts.

## ðŸ‘½ Who Is the Martian?

Back in middle school, my Physics teacher told me the only way to understand something was to pretend you were explaining it to a man from Mars.

I've never forgotten that.

At the end of every post you'll find a Martian ðŸ‘½. This is a plain-language TLDR written for someone from another world (or another field).

It breaks down:
- What I built
- Why it matters
- How to explain it to your obtuse martian friend

Because interpretability isn't just for the models â€” it's for the humans, too.
