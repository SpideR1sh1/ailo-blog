> Peeling back the layers of artificial minds — one story, one system, one week at a time.

Welcome to my blog, a storytelling-engineering journal that explores the strange, emotional, and sometimes unpredictable world of simulated intelligence. This blog documents the design of increasingly complex AI agents — not as models in a paper, but as characters in a world. You will hopefully see my successes, but more often you will see my failures.

Each post follows a weekly build cycle with:

- 🧠 new cognitive capabilities (memory, planning, belief, etc.)
- 🎮 playable sandbox simulations (built in Unity)
- ✍️ reflective writing that blends code, metaphor, and narrative

## 🎯 Core Goal

To build agents that don't just work — they remember, feel, and change.
This blog tracks that evolution, combining:

- Research-inspired engineering
- Weekly storytelling
- Experimental system design

## 📆 Current Phase

### 🧠 Phase 1: Simulated Mind in a Game World

A 12-week experiment in designing agents that live, reflect, and grow inside a Stardew Valley–style sandbox. Each week introduces a new layer of mind — from walking to memory to personality drift.

### 🗺️ Latest Progress

✅ [Week 1 – "It's Alive: Bootstrapping the Simulated Mind"](posts/week1.qmd) (Coming Soon)
- Building the bare-bones agent scaffold
- Movement, observation, and basic loop
- Event loop and reflex agents

## 🧰 Tools

| Stack | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 🛠 Unity | Game simulation & agent environment |
| 🧪 Python | Optional backend logic & memory manipulation |
| 📚 Quarto | Blog generation, visual embeds, interactivity |
| 🌐 OpenAI/HuggingFace | LLMs used in later phases (Phase 2 onward) |

## 🧅 What the Onion Means

Wherever you see this icon → 🧅
That marks a layered word: something that needs peeling.

Hover over the onion icon after a word to see its layered meaning!

These terms will have:
- The official definition
- And my AILOcard-style version — honest, funny, and functional

Example: **Belief** <span class="onion-term">🧅<div class="onion-tooltip">
  <h4>Belief</h4>
  <p><strong>Formal:</strong> A structured mental representation about the world held with some confidence.</p>
  <p><strong>AILO-style:</strong> A hunch the agent will probably act on… even if it's wrong.</p>
</div></span>

These definitions live in the [glossary](glossary.qmd) and appear in hover-tooltips throughout posts.

## 👽 Who Is the Martian?

Back in middle school, my Physics teacher told me the only way to understand something was to pretend you were explaining it to a man from Mars.

I've never forgotten that.

At the end of every post you'll find a Martian Mode 👽. This is a plain-language TLDR written for someone from another world — or another field.

It breaks down:
- What I built
- Why it matters
- How to explain it to your obtuse martian friend

Because interpretability isn't just for the models — it's for the humans, too.


## 🌱 Future Phases
This isn't just a one-off experiment. AILO unfolds across three interconnected phases:

| 🧭 Phase    | 🧠 Title                        | 🔬 Focus                                    | 👽 Simple explanation                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠Phase 1 | Simulated Mind in a Game World   | Agents, memory, mood, identity (Unity-based)| How intelligence is made — like growing a brain one behavior at a time   |
| 🔍Phase 2 | LLM Debugger                     | Visual tooling for understanding how LLMs think| How intelligence thinks — and how to actually look inside its head       |
| 🧪Phase 3 | Quantum-Native Reasoning         | Research into quantum-aligned reasoning systems| How intelligence can be redefined — with math that doesn't follow our rules |

## 🌀 Why This Blog Exists

This isn't a devlog. It's not a textbook.
It's a research-meets-narrative experiment — an engineering novel, one post at a time.

You'll see code.

You'll meet characters.

And you'll slowly forget whether the agent is simulating a mind — or you are.
