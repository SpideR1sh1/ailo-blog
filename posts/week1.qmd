# Week 1: It's Alive - Bootstrapping the Simulated Mind

> "Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it." — Frankenstein

## 🎯 This Week's Goal

In our first week, we're focusing on building the bare-bones agent scaffold. This includes:
- Basic movement capabilities
- Environmental observation
- Simple action loop
- Logging system for debugging

## 🧅 Key Terms

### Agent <span class="onion-term">🧅<div class="onion-tooltip">
<h4>Agent</h4>
<p><strong>Formal:</strong> An autonomous entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p><strong>AILO-style:</strong> A digital being that's learning to walk before it can run (or think, or feel).</p>
</div></span>

### Event Loop <span class="onion-term">🧅<div class="onion-tooltip">
<h4>Event Loop</h4>
<p><strong>Formal:</strong> A programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.</p>
<p><strong>AILO-style:</strong> The agent's internal clock that keeps it from standing still like a statue.</p>
</div></span>

### Reflex Agent <span class="onion-term">🧅<div class="onion-tooltip">
<h4>Reflex Agent</h4>
<p><strong>Formal:</strong> An agent that selects actions based on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history.</p>
<p><strong>AILO-style:</strong> A digital creature that reacts first and asks questions later (or never).</p>
</div></span>

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Simple Unity World
- Basic terrain setup
- Essential game objects
- Navigation mesh for agent movement

### Agent Prefab
- Movement controller
- State machine for idle/move behaviors
- Basic collision detection

### Logging System
- Event logging
- Action tracking
- State changes

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Event Loop
- Input processing
- State updates
- Action execution

### Input-Output Behavior
- Environmental perception
- Decision making
- Action execution

### Reflex Agents
- Simple stimulus-response patterns
- Basic decision making
- Immediate action execution

## 🔮 Next Steps

In Week 2, we'll be adding:
- Long-term memory system
- Time-stamped events
- Memory retrieval strategies

Greetings, Earthling! Let me explain what we built this week in simple terms:

**What We Built:**
A digital being that can move around and react to its environment. Think of it as a very simple robot that can walk and respond to basic commands.

**Why It Matters:**
Before we can build complex AI that thinks and feels, we need to start with the basics. This is like teaching a baby to crawl before it can walk.

**How to Explain It to Your Dog:**
*Woof!* (Translation: "It's like a new puppy learning to move its legs for the first time. Simple, but necessary!")

Stay tuned for more updates as we bring our first agent to life!
